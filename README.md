# Project Description

In this collaborative project we created a simple SPA in React. A To-do app which allows the user to create and manage tasks, as well as check off (or uncheck) the existing tasks when completed.

# App Functionalities 

The To-do app contains from 3 different pages:

## Home Page 

The Home Page is the first screen which the active user sees when openening the app. This page is displaying a list of tasks which were previosly created from the user. Besides having an overview of the created task list the user can also edit or delete the existing tasks as well as adding a new Task. When clicking on the task title the user is led to a dynamic page which is showing the task details like the current status of completition.

## Task History Page 

As mentioned above the user has the choice to delete the completed or unwanted tasks from the task list. Once the user deletes a task, it is  getting stored into the Task History Page which the user can acces through the sidebar. In the Task History page the user has an overview of the deleted tasks and the choice to undo the task and update it as an active task again in the task list.

## About Page 

In the About Page we are displaying a little bit of information of the team (Noelia, Hristina, Marine) which build the app.
